## Configuration options

These are the valid configuration options:

### **url**
You have to get a URL for your desired location by searching at [Yr](https://www.yr.no/?spr=eng). You can change to a different language (Norsk/Ny-norsk, sami or English) in upper right corner. When you have found your location, copy the link and paste into config's `url`. Keep last `/`!

### **refreshInterval**
How often you want the meteogram to update. Try to not refresh too often since it doesn't make sence.
